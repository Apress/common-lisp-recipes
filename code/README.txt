This directory contains example code for the book "Common Lisp
Recipes" by Edmund Weitz.

Note that this is NOT code that's meant to be actually used.  Some of
it is even defective or inefficient on purpose.  These are just
fragments intended to save you some typing if you want to follow the
book's text.

If the code doesn't agree exactly with what you see in the book,
you're probably looking at an updated version.  Please check the
errata and addenda at <http://weitz.de/cl-recipes/>.

Most files consist only of ASCII characters.  The few exceptions are
UTF-8 encoded and should open up in Emacs without problems.

There's a main file "code.lisp" for each chapter.  Some directories
also include additional Lisp code files and maybe also HTML files or
C, C++, or Java code.
